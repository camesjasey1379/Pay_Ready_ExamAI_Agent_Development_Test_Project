Subject: Extremely poor customer service experience

Dear Management,

I’m writing to express my disappointment after calling your support line yesterday. The representative was dismissive and hung up on me mid-conversation when I asked to speak to a supervisor.

I’ve been a loyal customer for over five years, but this experience has really shaken my confidence in your company.

Please have a manager contact me directly at 555-394-2921 to discuss this further.

Sincerely,
David R.
