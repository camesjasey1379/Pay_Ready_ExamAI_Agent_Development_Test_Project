Subject: Files not syncing properly across devices

Hi Support Team,

I’ve noticed that my documents aren’t syncing between my laptop and phone since the last app update. 
The app shows “Syncing…” indefinitely, but the changes never appear on the other device. 

I tried reinstalling and even logging out/in, but the issue persists. Can someone please help me fix this?

Best,
